### Business Objectives

The project aims to innovate the Scottish whiskey industry by fictionalising
cask investing using
semi-fungible token technology. It provides a secure, transparent, and
efficient solution for buying, selling, and investing in whiskey casks with a low barrier; to entry and return on investment.

The business objectives are

- Bring new users into the crypto ecosystem and a portion real GDP from the Â£7.1bn scottish whisky industry
- Bring new investment into the Whiskey industry by providing a ramp from the multi trillion dollar
  crypto market
- Enhance the profile of the Scottish Whiskey industry internationally
- Provide a high-quality, relatively stable investment vehicle for crypto investors
- Lower financial barriers to entry by fictionalising whiskey casks investments
- Provide a gateway for whisky investors to meet like-minded communities.
- Provide users with the status and novelty of owning an exiting asset
- Allow self-custody of digital assets, which are transferable liquid assets

*note: The software being developed is asset agnostic, it could be used for other use cases other
than whiskey investment and has value as a SAAS platform or re-sale of source code.*
