### Business Objectives


The project aims to innovate the Scottish whiskey industry by fictionalising whiskey-backed securities using
semi-fungible token technology. It provides secure, transparent, and
efficient solutions for buying, selling, and investing in whiskey with a return on investment.

The business objectives are

- Bring new users into the crypto ecosystem and real GDP of 71bn GBP on-chain
- Bring new investment into the Whiskey industry by providing a ramp from the 3+ trillion dollar
  crypto market
- Enhance the profile of the Scottish Whiskey industry internationally
- Provide a high-quality, relatively stable investment return to crypto investors
- Lower financial barriers to entry by fictionalising whiskey securities
- Provide a gateway for whisky investors to meet like-minded communities.
- Provide users with the status and novelty of owning an existing asset
- Allow self-custody of digital securities, which are transferable and liquid assets

*note: The software being developed is asset agnostic, it could be used for other use cases other
than whiskey bonds and has value as a SAAS platform or re-sale of source code.*
