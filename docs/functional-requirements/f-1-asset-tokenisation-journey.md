# Tokenize Whiskey Investment

### Description

The following journey describes the process an Admin takes when tokenising an asset. Assets are
chosen by the Dram team and consumed into the custodian framework.
The details of the asset are uploaded into the Dram system and
composed into a form suitable to tokenization. The asset data is distributed onto a public file
system and the NFT is deployed onto the blockchain. Finally, a sale contract is deployed that allows
customers to
purchase the asset.

### Journey Description

#### <ins>Select Whiskey investment</ins>

The dram team selects a Whiskey investment available from the investment agent.

#### <ins>Custody</ins>

The admin ensures that the asset is held in custody by a trusted third party. This is important for
the security and integrity of the asset.
Is an LLC per investment suitable for the asset with respect to cost of maintenance?

#### <ins>Initialise Details</ins>

The admin uploads the details of the Whiskey investment into the Dram system. This includes the name,
description, and any other relevant information about the asset.

#### <ins>Deploy Asset</ins>

The admin retrieves the Whiskey investment and custodial information from the storage service and bundles
it into a data package suitable for creating an NFT. This includes the asset's metadata, custodian
details, and any other relevant information.

#### <ins>Distribute data</ins>

The admin distributes the asset data into a public file system. This ensures that the asset's
metadata is accessible to anyone who wants to view it.

#### <ins>Deploy NFT</ins>

The admin deploys the NFT contract on the blockchain. This involves creating a smart contract that
represents the asset and its ownership.

##### <ins>Deploy NFT Sale</ins>

The admin deploys a sale contract that allows customers to purchase the asset. This contract
includes details about the sale, such as the price and any other relevant information.

process.
